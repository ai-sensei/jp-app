Learn Japanese with the help of AI!

## New Feature

This new feature allows users to practice their Japanese pronunciation by speaking into the microphone. The AI will then analyze the pronunciation and provide feedback on how to improve. To use this feature, navigate to the 'Pronunciation Practice' section in the app and press the 'Start' button. Make sure to allow the app to access your microphone when prompted.
